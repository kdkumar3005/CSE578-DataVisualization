			<h4>This is a visualization of the similarity between movies by means of a network graph</h4>
			<div style="width:100%;text-align:center;">
				<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/paulovn/9686202" target="_blank">Link to visualization</a></div>
			<p>
				<b>Summary:</b> <p>This visualization depicts the movies as nodes and a relationship between other movies as a path connecting them.
					The similarity here is not based on genre or director but by the way users interact with them and how they are rated, this is something
					similar to the "bought together" feature in amazon or other e-commerce websites. There are 25 most valued are highlighted in a red border
					and the area of their circle is also larger.The width of the line between the two movies reflect how similar they are, which means that 
					two very similar movies will be closer to each other.

				<li><b>Task:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Domain description:</b> <ul><li>Data:11000 movies in the Popcha app.</li>
						<li> Task: Top 150 movies and 25 most popular movies from the app.</li></ul></li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Idiom:</b> <p>In this visualization we see that there are nodes and lines connecting the nodes that are considered similar.
					<ul><li>Encoding Idiom</li>
						<ul><li>movies: circle</li>
							<li>Circle area: popularity</li>
							<li>Circle border (red): Top 25 </li></ul>	
					</ul>
					<ul><li>Interaction Idiom: On mouseover, the line reveal nodes that are similar. In terms of popcha user interaction.</li></ul>
				</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Personal Thoughts</b> This visualization saves time during a movie night. Having the ability to view similar movies will provide users
				with a reference to the kind of movie chosen. The area of the circle and the border changes based on popularity, this helps us to find
				them with ease. This visualization can probably be enhanced further by providing meaning to the spatial arrangement of the 
				different nodes.
